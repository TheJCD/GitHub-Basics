How to use the Terminal

This was initially a practice tutorial conducted by myself on how to learn Git - it was meant to be a reference guide on how to use Bootstrap but I messed around the majority of the day on how to push, merge, pull, fork etc and getting used to Github. Read this README on more if you want to know the easy method on how to get your projects started on Github!

Step 1
Go to the folder where you want to go on your computer
I assume you have started up a repo on GitHub.com? If not, get to it. Then come back to here, grab the URL of your repo, then you can start creating branches on here.
