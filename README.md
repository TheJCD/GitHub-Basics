# hello WOooooo000000rld!
A reference guide for beginner people such as myself on how to use Github and the command line!

This tutorial assumes you have GIT installed and you have familisarised yourself with creating a repo on GitHub - that is all you will need to know.

This was initially a practice tutorial conducted by myself on how to learn Git - it was meant to be a reference guide on how to use Bootstrap but I messed around the majority of the day on how to push, merge, pull, fork etc and getting used to Github. <br/> Read this README on more if you want to know the easy method on how to get your projects started on Github!

# How to make clones, check status, commiting and pushing without making a new branch. (STAGE 1, we will get to merging later.)

Step 1 <br/>
Go to the folder where you want to go on your computer <br/>
I assume you have started up a repo on GitHub.com? If not, get to it. Then come back to here, grab the URL of your repo, then you can start creating branches on here.<br/>

Step 2 <br/>
Once inside the folder you want to be in, type in git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/name-of-repo-here <br/>
This will essentially copy what is on the repo onto your local machine. <br/>

Step 3 <br/>
Make some changes! <br/>

Step 4 <br/>
Now you have made some changes you can see where you stand with what changes you have made by typing in git status <br/>
This will show what files have been modified and need to be added in order to be pushed back up into the repo. <br/>
Type in git add [name of page you have changed] then hit return<br/>
It is of good practice to leave messages to see what commits you have made in the past so other members of your team or outsiders can see what changes have been made (version control!!) so type in git commit -m "type in a description here" - this also locks changes into the repo<br/>
Finally you need to push the changes you have made on your local and push it back to GitHub by simply pressing git push.<br/>

Step 5<br/>
Done!
